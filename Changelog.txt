v2.1 beta 1
+ Add initial theme support
    Currently no theme editor within the scoreboard, but custom themes can be added manually
    Button currently cycles through loaded themes, but a full GUI for selecting a theme will be added in the future
    Currently has a dark theme and a light theme
* Bids no longer show at all until entered, instead of showing a 0
    Each player must have a bid entered directly, even if that bid is 0
    Right-clicking will initialize bid to 0
    Left-clicking will initialize bid to 1
* Code cleanup
    Subclasses split into separate files
- Known issue: It is possible to bypass bid checks by adding a player after bids have been entered

v2.0
  No changes from 2.0rc4; Release project on GitHub

v2.0 release candidate 4
* Revert a change made in 2.0rc2 that became redundant in 2.0rc3

v2.0 release candidate 3
* Use textAlign(CENTER, CENTER) instead of a weird hack to align the trick sequence preview

v2.0 release candidate 2
+ Added two more suits: dots and crosses, corresponding to a six-suit deck
    These are shown in a blue color and can be accessed using the keys O and X respectively or by cycling through the suits as usual
* Fixed the trick sequence editor being broken in 2.0rc1
* The trick sequence preview now stays aligned vertically when the text size changes

v2.0 release candidate 1
* Reworked tile system to be based on overall width and height rather than requiring references to PApplet.width and PApplet.height in every Tile constructor
    Tile constructor now takes four floats between 0 and 1 which are mapped into coordinates
* drawButton() method now takes a text size multiplier which is scaled to screen width
    All uses of this method previously used a small number multiplied by width (i.e. 0.02*width)
    Such a parameter would be replaced with simply 0.02
* Some debug functionality has been unified under a single variable (boolean debug)
    This currently includes frametime displaying as well as printing the system properties on startup
* Increased the frequency of blinking while editing text from 1 Hz to 1.5 Hz

v2.0 beta 7
* Reworked state saving and loading to use a new format
    It is now possible for names to include semicolons
    Commas are still not allowed

v2.0 beta 6
+ Added logging for each hand
    This shows how many tricks each player bid and took as well as the change in their score
    Autosaves in a separate file (latest.log) but is merged into the final save file upon game completion
+ Hands played is now stored globally
    Previously it was stored per-player
    This new value is also stored in the autosave format
* Fixed several variable names to be more consistent
* Overrode PApplet#loadImage(String) to immediately exit the program if an image can't be loaded
    This avoids needing to check if each PImage is null individually
- Known issue: Autosave format is generally not compatible across versions and is difficult to read [FIXED: 2.0b7]
    This should be addressed before v2.0 is finished

v2.0 beta 5
* Fixed club and heart icons being reversed due to mistake in 2.0b4

v2.0 beta 4
+ Added "end game" button
    Ends game and saves result as normal
    Requires enter + right click to confirm
* Slightly shifted GUI to accommodate new button
* Fixed directory handling by detecting platform-specific separator
* Fixed error message fade-out to be timed based on 30 fps rather than 50
* Fixed error message fading failing to block program from entering low-framerate mode
* Simplified code in a few places
    Merged some variable declarations into single lines based on logical grouping
    Added a new trumpIcon() method to avoid repetitive if-statements
    Changed getKeyValue() and trickMode() methods to use switch blocks instead of if-statements

v2.0 beta 3
* Trump suit indicator is no longer font-based and now uses images, to avoid issues with the default font sometimes not including the suits
* Active framerate decreased from 50 to 30; passive framerate remains 2

v2.0 beta 2
+ Added framerate limiting after no interaction for 2 seconds in order to improve power efficiency
+ Added restart button to game over screen
+ Added trick index (i.e. hand number) to autosave format
* Save directory now works on Linux
- Known issue: Save directory no longer works on Windows [FIXED: 2.0b4]
- Known issue: Some graphical effects may be impacted by the new framerate-limiting feature


v2.0 beta 1
+ Added autosave and autoload capabilities
    For now, this simply saves the state of the scoreboard continuously and loads the save upon opening the program
* Improved how negative scores are displayed
    The minus sign is drawn separately from the number, and is repositioned and reduced in width
* Scores that overflow are now cut off graphically, rather than overflowing into adjacent cells
- Names can no longer include the characters , and ;
    This may be changed in the future
